# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Classifier

   This is my first machine learning project. I have learned a lot of ideas and keypoints in analyzing the data from various kernels with 
   explanations, while doing this project. This project is based on the dataset available in Kaggle website. The dataset contains various features like Survival, pclass(Ticket class)
   sex, age, sibsp(siblings/spouse of passenger), Parch(Parent/children of passenger), ticket, fare, cabin, embarked(port of embarkation)
   Using the features given, we need to predict whether passenger is survived or dead. 
   
   Preprocessing:
     I have done the preprocessing by filling the values for the missing features which are needed and removed the features which has only 
     very little effect like passengerId.I have compared the output variable with other features to identify how other features affects the 
     output variable. The selection of the features has been done based on the analysis of the impact of the features with the output variable.
   Model:
     I built two models - Random Forest classifier and Support Vector Machine. Among these two, Support vector machine gave higher accuracy
     for this dataset compared to the random forest classifier. So, I have used Support vectore machine.
